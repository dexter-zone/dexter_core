# Defunct Pool Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan implements defunct pool functionality directly in the vault contract. A defunct pool is completely shut down (unlike paused which allows some operations) and users can be refunded their proportional share of pool assets.

## Architecture Decision
- ✅ **Add to Vault Contract** (vs new contract)
- Reasons: Direct access to pool state, atomic operations, simpler architecture

## Implementation Notes

### Key Files to Modify:
1. `packages/dexter/src/vault.rs` - Add types
2. `contracts/vault/src/state.rs` - Add storage
3. `contracts/vault/src/error.rs` - Add errors  
4. `contracts/vault/src/contract.rs` - Add functions
5. `contracts/vault/tests/defunct_pool.rs` - Add tests

### Critical Requirements:
- **Atomicity**: Defunct operation must be atomic (remove from ACTIVE_POOLS and add to DEFUNCT_POOLS)
- **Safety**: All existing operations must check defunct status
- **Accuracy**: LP token calculations must account for all states (direct, bonded, locked, unlocked)
- **Prevention**: Cannot defunct pools with active reward schedules

### Testing Strategy:
- **Unit Tests**: Test each function in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows
- **Error Tests**: Test all error conditions
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure existing functionality unchanged

### Code Quality:
- Follow existing code patterns and style
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Use consistent error handling
- Include detailed events for indexing
